# The_Sierpinski_Triangle

This triangle, named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, is a fractal shape that exhibits self-similarity. It is created by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller triangles. 

The construction of the Sierpinski Triangle starts with an initial equilateral triangle. Then, this triangle is divided into four smaller equilateral triangles by connecting the midpoints of its sides. The central triangle formed in this process is removed, leaving behind three smaller triangles. This process is repeated recursively for each of the remaining triangles, resulting in a fractal pattern.

In my case, however, I used a different formula to construct it. I also started with an equilateral triangle and then drew a point inside the triangle. From that point, I randomly selected one of the three vertices and drew a point at exactly half the distance between them. This process is repeated for an arbitrary number of points.
After enough points have been drowned, the triangle can be seen.
